This is an experimental canvas-based animated clock that aims to encourage long-term thinking.

The short explanation is that it's a clock that goes beyond the traditional short-term scope of
minute/seconds/hours, and displays year decade, and life progress.  I'd like to eventually some form of zoom / view controls
to allow for more time contexts at either end of the scale (watch microseconds flash by, compare to life of sun, etc.).

Also would like to better represent future time periods (the clock simply doesn't draw there now) - maybe offer a visualiaztion of the level of uncertainty of an event timeframe?  Another possibility would be to add scheduled events and display them in the space of the ring.

There are probably bugs - this was just a quick project to see what this type of clock would look like.
