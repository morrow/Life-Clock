This is an experimental canvas-based animated clock that aims to encourage long-term thinking.

The short explanation is that it's a clock that goes beyond the traditional short-term scope of
minute/seconds/hours, and displays year decade, and life progress.  I'd like to eventually some form of zoom
to allow for more time contexts at either end of the scale (watch microseconds flash by, compare to life of sun, etc.)

Also would like to better represent future time periods (the clock simply doesn't draw there now) - maybe offer a visualiaztion of the level of uncertainty of an event timeframe?

Just an overnight experiment to see what it would look like if this were actually built.  I know someone else has made something like this, but I couldn't remember if it had the same format - and I'm pretty sure whatever I saw was made in flash.
