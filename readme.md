This is an experimental canvas-based animated clock that aims to encourage long-term thinking.

The short explanation is that it's a clock that goes beyond the traditional short-term scope of
minute/seconds/hours, and displays year decade, and life progress.  I'd like to eventually some form of zoom / view controls
to allow for more time contexts at either end of the scale (watch microseconds flash by, compare to life of sun, etc.).

Also would like to better represent future time periods (the clock simply doesn't draw there now) - maybe offer a visualiaztion of the level of uncertainty of an event timeframe?  Another possibility would be to add scheduled events and display them in the space of the ring.

There are probably bugs - this was just a quick project to see what this type of clock would look like.

Inspired on some level, I'm sure, by this quote: 

“Almost everything–all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure–these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.” – Steve Jobs
